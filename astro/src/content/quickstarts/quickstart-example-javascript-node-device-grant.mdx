FusionAuth Device Authorization Grant workflow example
====
A basic HTML/JavaScript app demonstrating the Device Authorization Request and Device Access Token Request of the [Oauth2 Device Authorization Grant](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8628) specification.

Use in conjunction with an installation of FusionAuth to demo the entire Device Grant workflow.

Usage
----

1. [Download and install FusionAuth](https://fusionauth.io/download)
1. [Create an Application](https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/tutorials/create-an-application)
    1. Enable Device Grant on the OAuth tab under "Enabled grants"
    1. Enter a Device Verification URL. 
      - This URL should be as short (and sweet) as possible.
      - This URL will be either landing page to your application that can perform a `302` redirect to the FusionAuth device page with the required request parameters or a URL configured in a proxy to perform the same redirect.
      - For example, `https://acme.com/activate` which would be able to redirect to `https://login.acme.com/oauth2/device?client_id={client_id}&tenantId={tenantId}` where `https://login.acme.com` is the URL of your FusionAuth service.
    1. Click save (blue icon at the top right).
1. Update the [FusionAuth CORS policy](https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/reference/cors)
    1. Add `http://localhost:8080` to "Allowed origins"
    1. Check "POST" as an "Allowed methods"
    1. Click save. 
1. Edit the `main.js` file in this project
    1. Change `baseFusionAuthURL` to your base FusionAuth URL
    1. Change `clientId` to that of the newly created Application in the previous step
1. Run this example
    1. Run `python3 -m http.server --bind 127.0.0.1` to start a simple HTTP server for the `index.html` file.
    1. Open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser
    1. Click the "Click to Start" button
