# FusionAuth Java Client example

Basic example of the FusionAuth Java client libraries.

Configure this by updating the `application.properties` file with your API key and the location of your FusionAuth server. 

Then run `mvn clean compile`.

For example: `mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="io.fusionauth.example.CreateApplication"`
