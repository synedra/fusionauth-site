# Example Simple Device Limiting Express.js Application Using Webhooks

This repo holds an example Express.js application that uses FusionAuth as the identity provider. 
This application will use an OAuth Authorization Code Grant workflow to log a user in and 
get them access and refresh tokens. It also implements a form of device limiting using FusionAuth's APIs and webhooks. This is a simpler example of device limiting which requires the end user to manually log out of a device when they reach the device limit.

You can read more about device limiting in the [Device Limiting Guide](https://fusionauth.io/docs/extend/examples/device-limiting) on the FusionAuth website. The guide also contains alternative solutions to implementing device limiting and links to relevant GitHub issues.

This application is based on the [Express.js Quickstart](https://fusionauth.io/docs/quickstarts/quickstart-javascript-express-web/).

## Project Contents

The `docker-compose.yml` file and the `kickstart` directory are used to start and configure a local FusionAuth server.

The `/complete-application` directory contains a fully working version of the application.

## Project Dependencies
* Docker, for running FusionAuth
* Node 16 or later, for running the Changebank Express.js application

## FusionAuth Installation via Docker

In the root of this project directory (next to this README) are two files [a Docker compose file](./docker-compose.yml) and an [environment variables configuration file](./.env). Assuming you have Docker installed on your machine, you can stand up FusionAuth up on your machine with:

```
docker compose up -d
```

The FusionAuth configuration files also make use of a unique feature of FusionAuth, called [Kickstart](https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/installation-guide/kickstart): when FusionAuth comes up for the first time, it will look at the [Kickstart file](./kickstart/kickstart.json) and mimic API calls to configure FusionAuth for use when it is first run. 

> **NOTE**: If you ever want to reset the FusionAuth system, delete the volumes created by docker compose by executing `docker compose down -v`. 

FusionAuth will be initially configured with these settings:

* Your client Id is: `e9fdb985-9173-4e01-9d73-ac2d60d1dc8e`
* Your client secret is: `super-secret-secret-that-should-be-regenerated-for-production`
* Your example username is `richard@example.com` and your password is `password`.
* Your admin username is `admin@example.com` and your password is `password`.
* Your fusionAuthBaseUrl is 'http://localhost:9011/'

You can log into the [FusionAuth admin UI](http://localhost:9011/admin) and look around if you want, but with Docker/Kickstart you don't need to.

## Running the Example App
To run the application, first go into the project directory

```shell
cd complete-application
```

Install dependencies

```shell
npm install
```

Start the application

```shell
npm run dev
```
